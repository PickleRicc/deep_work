**Ideation Environments**

Cal Newport differentiates between original focused ideation done while walking and serendipitous ideation sparked by reading by the fire.
Andrew Huberman theorizes that creativity and productivity are facilitated by a body in motion with a free mind, or a still body with an active mind.

<blockquote><b>Cal Newport</b><br/><br/>I do a lot of my original focused ideating on foot, but a lot of my serendipitous ideating will be with the fire going. It's the way I read by the fire. It's when I read that I get a lot of my original ideas.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Andrew Huberman</b><br/><br/>I have this theory that the two opposite states of mind that both facilitate creativity and productivity look something like this. You can tell me whether or not this maps to anything that you know. One is, just as you described, our body is in motion and could be running walking. It might even be in the shower or something of that sort, but we aren't trying to direct our mind toward a specific linear trajectory or outcome. It's not like working out an equation or a theorem the same way we would if we were at a piece of paper or writing out a sentence, a structured paragraph. It's body in motion, mind not channeled toward one specific target. The opposite</blockquote>

**Expensive Notebooks**

Cal Newport bought an expensive archival-quality lab notebook as a postdoc to take his work more seriously.
He used it for two years, carefully writing notes that led to seven peer-reviewed papers or funded grants.

<blockquote><b>Cal Newport</b><br/><br/>Because I thought, okay, look, I'm going to take it more seriously. Because I think that's also part of what goes on with the whiteboard is your mind thinks about writing on the big vertical space as a public crystallization of thoughts. I'm putting this up for people to see. Even if there's no one actually there to see it. And so you take it more seriously. If I'm writing on a whiteboard in class, I'm not just going to put up nonsense. I'm going to be very careful about what I'm writing, because you imagine there's an audience. This is something for other people to see. And so you get a little bit of a similar effect. If you have a very nice notebook, you think, look, I don't want to waste pages. And somehow that helps with the thinking. So then I found this notebook because I store my old notebooks in my closet. So I found it. And when I was working on a recent book, I found it. I went through it. And then I started ticking off this turned into a paper, this turned into a grant. This notebook, I used it for maybe two years, only used maybe about half the pages. It's all very careful, neat script and diagrams. I think I found seven different peer reviewed papers or funded grants where the core ideas were in this notebook. So it's like that $70 was an incredible investment. Because when I got to work in that notebook, it must have been pushing my thinking to a new level because it was an incredible concentration of actual publishable results were coming Out of its pages.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Andrew Huberman</b><br/><br/>Yeah, it seems like we would all do well, regardless of our field, to have some very low bar method of capture, where if we just have an idea that spontaneously comes to mind that we can Capture that in a voice memo or dare I say, a phone notes segment. But then something as you're suggesting, like a whiteboard, like a bound notebook,</blockquote>

**Active Recall**

When trying to learn from a text, don't just highlight and underline.
Instead, take a break, try to recall specific elements, and then check the material.

<blockquote><b>Andrew Huberman</b><br/><br/>What you think of this, what I always call protocol. If I want to learn something from a manuscript I read or a book chapter, I used to highlight things and I had a very elaborate extracted from my university days system of stars and exclamation Marks and underlined that mean a lot to me that can, yes, bring me back to a given segment within the chapter. But a few years ago, I was teaching a course in the biology department at Stanford and for some reason, we had them read a study about information retention. I learned from that study, one of the best things we can do is read information in whatever form, a magazine, research article, etc. A book. Then to take some time away from that material, maybe walk, maybe close one of the eyes, maybe leave them open, doesn't matter. Just try and remember specific elements. How much does one remember? Then go back to the material and look at it. I've just been positively astonished at how much more information I can learn when I'm not simply going through motor commands of just underlining things and highlighting them, but Stepping away and thinking, okay, I don't remember how many subjects that were, I'll go back and check that, maybe make a note and okay, they did this, then they did that, and then it's Crystallized.

**Cal Newport's Study Experiment**

Cal Newport experimented with different study methods after being forced to quit rowing due to a heart condition.
Through trial and error, he discovered that active recall was the most effective technique for him.

<blockquote><b>Cal Newport</b><br/><br/>It was my key. Like the whole premise that got me writing that book is I went through this period as a college student where I came in freshman year was like a fine student, not a great student, but a fine Student. And I was rowing crew and I was sort of like excited to do that. And then I developed a heart condition and had to stop congenital wiring in the heart, atrial flutter thing. I mean, I couldn't recruit anymore. It was a circuitry issue that would lead to an extremely rapid heartbeat. It's like a really rapid like ticardia, right? You get 250 beats a minute just and it could be exercise induced, right? Which is not optimal. You could take beta blockers, which would moderate the electrical timing, but beta blockers reduce your max heart rate. And if you're an athlete where the entire thing that matters is your max heart rate. So you're doing something like a 2000 meter rose, your performance on beta blockers just goes down. It makes no sense. It's like being a basketball player that worries weighted shoes. It's too frustrating. It also makes you super mellow. I was pretty mellow guy, but I was a worse rower. So I stopped that. I was like, okay, I want to get serious about my studies. I was like, I can get serious about my studies in writing, right? That's when I actually made the decisions they didn't stuck with for the next 25 years after that. But one of the things I</blockquote>

**Deliberate Practice with Guitar**

Cal Newport studied a professional guitar player to understand how experts improve.
He learned that they focus on pushing 20% beyond their comfort zone and concentrating intensely during practice.

<blockquote><b>Cal Newport</b><br/><br/>And so I spent time with a professional guitar player. I just wanted to see how he practiced. Like, what does this actually look like? What I learned from them is like, what they do is, yeah, they have the music in front of them. But for them, it's all speed. So they take a piece. He was working on licks for he was a new acoustic style player and they had these kind of bluegrassy type licks. And he probably had to memorize and he knew how fast he could comfortably play it. For them, it's all about adding 20% to what they're comfortably doing. And then that push passed through there comfortable. And the thing I remember writing about him was he was concentrating so hard to try to hit this lick 20% faster than he was used to it as he'd forget the breathe. So he'd be like, going, going, going, and then just gasp, you know, like his body would, you know, force him to breathe. So yeah, there it seemed</blockquote>

<blockquote><b>Cal Newport</b><br/><br/>Actually led to a bit of a battle because of my readers, there was this a this battle that emerged where people were trying to combine Anders Ericsson and deliberate practice with Mihaly Chinkzittmihai and Flow. And really, they were trying to make Flow apply everywhere. Like it's all about Flow, deliberate practices, Flow, everything is Flow, the whole thing is to get into a state of Flow. And I remember Anders talking about this at some point and say like, no, no, no, like the state of practice that makes you better. It's the opposite of Flow, right? And Flow, you lose track of time. When you're practicing like that professional guitar player, you know, every second it passes by because it's like incredibly difficult. Like what you're doing, your mind is rebelling. It's not natural, you know, it's not fun. It's not the skier going down the hill and it's all instinct. It's you, it's all you thinking about exactly what you're trying to do. And so, you know, I began to push this point out here is like, it's not all about Flow, like actually getting better at things is really painful sometimes. Deliberate practice is not the same as Flow. And there's</blockquote>

**Discomfort and Learning**

Andrew Huberman explains that discomfort and agitation are cues for the nervous system to rewire neurons, which is essential for learning.
Without these cues, the brain sees no reason to devote energy to neuroplasticity.

<blockquote><b>Andrew Huberman</b><br/><br/>Dopamine, because it's involved in so many things, can be a little bit of a distractor. So let's just say epinephrine, nor epinephrine, adrenaline, noradrenaline, create in the body and mind to some extent a state of alertness and often a state of agitation. But if you think about it, in the absence of some neuromodulators like those that change the conditions for wiring of neurons, everyone loves fire together, wired together. A beautiful statement by Carla Shatz, not Donald Hebb, Dr. Carla Shatz said that, not Donald Hebb. But why would neurons need to change their patterns of connectivity if you can complete the operation? The nervous system needs to, it doesn't feel discomfort, it creates discomfort, but the nervous system needs a queue. Okay, this is different. I'm failing. And it's the failures that actually trigger the plasticity, it's the discomfort that queues that conditions are different now. Otherwise, there's simply no reason to devote energetic resources to rewiring neurons. And I feel like we don't learn this when we're kids. And I think as kids, we can learn so much without that feeling of agitation. We get into these modes of looking for flow. And I have respect for the research on flow and the people who are balding. But I'd like to talk about flow a little bit. The only thing I really know about flow for sure is that backwards it spells wolf. So one of flow, it's such an attractive idea, right? It's like Star Wars. It's like you have the force or vogue, and you're doing things without thinking. And awesome. But I can't flow myself through a paper and extract the critical data.

**Cognitive Disorder**

Constant checking of email and Slack results in cognitive disorder, reducing cognitive output. Spend the entire day switching between tasks without fully locking onto any of them.
Getting rid of constant checking makes you feel like you're on the world's best neurotropic.

<blockquote><b>Cal Newport</b><br/><br/>You were never in a state then in your day, where you don't have a confused cognitive space, where you don't have partially you were switching to this task, but then you switch back to This task before that finish, but before you could fully lock it on this task, you look back over here. And so you're spending your entire day in this state of cognitive disorder, which is going to be reduced cognitive output. So you get rid of that. I always say, one of my advantages is not that I'm doing anything smarter. I'm just avoiding sometimes the dumb thing, just holding, slowing other people down. You get rid of that, and you feel like you're on the world's best neurotrophic or something like this. I'm just doing this thing. I'm doing it pretty well. Now I'm done. This didn't even take that long. So I mean, I think people underestimate what's going on here.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Andrew Huberman</b><br/><br/>I'd like to take a quick break to acknowledge our sponsor element. Elements is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need, and nothing you don't. That means zero sugar, and the appropriate ratios of the electrolyte, sodium, magnesium, and potassium. And that correct ratio of electrolytes is extremely important, because every cell in your body, but especially your nerve cells, your neurons, relies on electrolytes in order to Function properly. So when you're well hydrated, and you have the appropriate amount of electrolytes in your system, your mental functioning and your physical functioning is improved. I drink one packet of element dissolved in about 16 to 32 ounces of water when I wake up in the morning, as well as while I exercise. And if I've sweat a lot during that exercise, I often will drink a third element packet dissolved in about 32 ounces of water after I exercise. Element comes in a variety of different flavors, all of which I find really tasty. I like the citrus, I like the watermelon, I like the raspberry. Frankly, I can't pick just one. It also comes in chocolate and chocolate mint, which I find tastes best if they are put into water dissolved and then heated up. I tend to do that in the winter months, because of course you don't just need hydration on hot days, and in the summer and spring months, but also in the winter when the temperatures are Cold and the environment tends to be dry. If you'd like to try element, you can go to drink element spelled lmnt.com slash Huberman to try a free sample pack. Again, that's drink element.com slash Huberman. Yeah, we'd like to drill into the concept of context and task switching a bit more. I do think that the brain has something akin to a transmission system where,</blockquote>

**Neuro-Semantic Coherence**

Cal Newport introduces 'neuro-semantic coherence' as a more accurate term for the state of deep work than 'flow'.
It describes a state of intense concentration where only relevant neural networks are activated, while unrelated ones are inhibited.

No, let's invent a term. And you tell me the term makes sense. I'm even just on the fly, but neuro-semantic coherence. This is going to be my alternative term for flow. When you're working on something hard, it's not that you're in an actual flow state where you lose track what you're doing. You're concentrating really hard, but what I'm saying neuro-semantic coherence is you get to this place where the sort of relevant semantic neural networks are all those that are Activated are all relevant to what you're doing. And you've over time inhibited most of the unrelated networks that were fired up before. And so you get in this sense of</blockquote>

**Video Game Addiction**

If you allow your kids to play video games, choose offline games like Nintendo Switch games.
Avoid online games designed to be addictive through upcharges and constant engagement.

<blockquote><b>Cal Newport</b><br/><br/>That seems more solvable to me. My solution with my own kids, I don't mind being a big game. I'm a computer scientist, but I said nothing that's online, right? Nothing that was free. Because if it was free, that means their business model involves getting you to play it all the time so you can upcharge or whatever. They have Nintendo switches. Like I like Nintendo. Okay, Nintendo switch. Here's a $60 L the game that someone spent five years making or whatever. You can only play those games so long at a time before you're tired, you come back to it. They don't have an addictive response to it. If they get an iPad with a game on it, they'll just like play that till their eyes bleed because those are meant to be addictive. So I'm wary about video games, but there it's all just a usage game. So you stick away from the more addictive games. It's a much easier problem to solve, I think, than the social media issue.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Andrew Huberman</b><br/><br/>Earlier you talked about books.

**Pseudo-Productivity**

'Pseudo-productivity,' using visible activity as a proxy for effort, was manageable until the IT revolution.
Email and Slack made it too easy to demonstrate effort constantly, leading to burnout.
#### 📚 Transcript
<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>
<blockquote><b>Cal Newport</b><br/><br/>Problem came when we had this general way of measuring approximating productive effort, which wasn't very good, but whatever. I want to see you're at the office and you're doing things. The problem was the front office IT revolution. I'm essentially a technocratic. I see everything through the lens of technology in my writing. We got computers, we got networks, we got email. Pseudo productivity can't be sustainable in that context because now with something like email, then later tools like Slack, I can demonstrate effort at a very fine grain, because I can send an email, respond to this, jump onto a Slack conversation. I can now do that at a very fine grain level and essentially everywhere and anywhere. All throughout my day, I can be demonstrating labor. At home, I can be demonstrating labor because we have mobile computing. We get the smartphone revolution. There's now an ability to constantly be demonstrating effort at all points of our day. That's where I think the wheels came off the bus. Led to this point that got worse and worse, starting the early 2000s and hit ahead in the pandemic of knowledge worker burnout, knowledge worker exhaustion and nihilism of what's going On with my job. All I do is zoom all day. What's happening? I think that's shooter productivity plus front office IT revolution. They did not play nice together. You can see this, by the way, if you look even at productivity books, you see this huge shift that happens early 90s versus early 2000s. It's like a completely shift in tone. Early 90s, it's Stephen Covey, it's very optimistic. It's like, how are we going to self-actualize and carefully choose the most meaningful activities to fulfill all of our dreams, for all of our roles? Early 2000s, now we have email. You have David Allen. It's like, oh my God, we're so overwhelmed with task. All we can hope for is like these little moments of zen in the day. If we can just automate how we're just turning through these widgets, at least we can find some cognitive piece. What happened in those 10 years was the front office IT revolution. Now we just felt like we had to constantly be demonstrating the visible effort. I think that's where we got into the problem. Sooted productivity plus technology.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Andrew Huberman</b><br/><br/>Recently,</blockquote>

Huberman realized the friction of returning to social media, whereas the lack of friction can be scary.

<blockquote><b>Andrew Huberman</b><br/><br/>My podcast team was in Australia. My producer and close friend here, Rob Moore, instructed all of us to get rid of social media on our phones, except one guy who would post our weekly episodes announcements. It was pretty brutal at first. Then coming back to social media, it actually turned out to be more challenging. You really experienced the friction coming back the other way. Then one experiences the lack of friction, and that's where it gets scary. It's so interesting the way that the brain can adapt. The friction leaving something behind. The friction coming back to it. I think for people listening to this, I raise this because I think, of course, many people listening have work that they really need to focus on. They may be having issues with productivity and burnout, etc. I think a lot of people use the phone in social media because it fills their life. It provides some enrichment and they aren't necessarily committed to specific projects.

**Phone-Induced Attention Issues**

Many subclinical attention issues stem from phone use, not necessarily neural rewiring.
These issues are more about behavioral addictions in malleable reward circuits and can be fixed.
#### 📚 Transcript

<summary>Click to expand</summary>
<blockquote><b>Cal Newport</b><br/><br/>A lot of these issues are phone induced. And I think the problem is not solvable as much. You don't need pills. You need a different phone relationship. My optimistic hypothesis is again, this non-clinical difficulty with maintaining attention, like in your work, or if you're a college student or whatever, is not necessarily representing Knock on wood, like a wholesale neural rewiring. I've basically rewired my circuits on my brain to be a sort of distributed switching processor. I think most of this is persisting in that much more malleable area that gets affected by moderate behavioral addictions. So we have parts of the brain that are part of these feedback reward loops that's meant to be malleable. So we can have really rapid learning about what's happening in our environment and how we're supposed to respond to it. And this is what gets hijacked when you build up these behavioral addictions. And so it's very quick to change. But that malleability means you can change it back. So I think this drive to I have to keep checking my email or my phone is again, you build up a moderate behavioral addiction because of standard reward cues. And that's a part of the brain that you can't, it's difficult, but it's not your whole brain is now a social media brain. And that's just the brain you have because you're exposed to this. It's a matter of getting this stimuli out of your life doing the same type of training you would do, it's boredom exposure, like it used to the idea of feeling that drive and not actually Doing it, you can work with blocking apps like there's stuff you can do. This is sort of like standard, it's painful, it takes two months, and then like you're doing</blockquote>

**Embrace Boredom**

Take short breaks from distraction daily to break the Pavlovian connection between boredom and phone use.
By sometimes resisting the urge for distraction, your mind becomes more accustomed to focus.

<blockquote><b>Cal Newport</b><br/><br/>Now, this is an idea I've written about before. In Deepork, I had this chapter called Embrace Boredom. That was the entire idea. So the idea was boredom by itself is not I think laudable. There's a reason why it feels distressing. When things feel distressing, that's usually an evolutionary signal that there's something going on here. But what I was arguing in that chapter was exactly what you're talking about. You should have some moments every day where you're free from distraction, even though you could be accessing distraction and you want to. And like a little bit each day, 20 minutes each day, and then maybe a longer session once a week, like a couple hours. My argument for that was it's about breaking a Pavlovian connection in this sense. So if it's every time I feel bored, I'm lack of novel stimuli, I get this release of the phone. Your mind is really going to make that association of like, this is what we always do. If sometimes you don't,</blockquote>

A huge portion of our brain is dedicated to this, right? So it's a very cognitively expensive activity when I'm trying to understand another humans what they're saying. I'm simulating their mental state. I'm trying to understand like where do they fall in this sort of social hierarchy. And one of my arguments was when you spend your entire day in that state, it's exhausting and anxiety producing.

Now that I see that there's a lot of gaps in the middle of the day here, they're short. Maybe there I'm going to do a lot of small non-converly demanding thing. Oh, this first 90 minutes in the morning is like the main time I have uninterrupted. Okay. So this I'm going to work on writing. So I've been a big believer this since I was an undergrad.

What would happen if I couldn't sleep? I want to be able to do that. So it I drifted naturally towards a definition of productivity, which was it doesn't really matter if you work tomorrow. But it is important that like this month you work like writing a book, it doesn't matter if you work on your book chapter tomorrow in particular. But like this month, you have to spend a lot of time working on it. So it was like an insomnia compatible definition of productivity was sort of morphed into this idea of slow productivity, taking your time with it. So it's interesting.

Synchronize the schedule, here's at home days, here's an office days, but for everybody, for everybody, or have a few of these schedules, but like groups of people who work together Have the same schedule, but then make the rule at home days, no meetings, no email. Like, that's the way to really get the full benefit out of hybrid work. When we're in the office, we have meetings and we can talk about work and we're at home, we're just doing work and we can do it without distraction and we can just stay deep and really turn Through things. I think it would really make a big difference on the overload issue. I think it would be much more sustainable. Remote work, because I did a lot of coverage remote work as this was first emerging the early pandemic. There, I became convinced, I was doing this twice a month column for the New Yorker back then that was just looking at the pandemic transforming work. And I came away with the idea that remote work can be fantastic, but it's difficult. And it can't just be, do the job you were doing in person, but just do it at home and we have Zoom and we'll figure it out. Like, if you're going to be fully remote, we have to rethink what work means for that. And there's a lot of differences it needs to have. It needs to be way more structured. It probably needs to be, you're working on less things. It's very clear what you're working on. The collaboration is much more defined and much less frequent. You probably need to</blockquote>

And what I mean by that is when you keep track of what you're working on, have the top part of that list, which is I'm actively working on these things and keep that top part of your list to Like two or three things. Everything else is in the bottom part of the list. It's to work on next and it's in an ordered queue. And so when you finish something that you're working on, you pull something new to take it slot from the list below. Right. So what I'm trying to do with that advice is reduce all this administrative overhead. Because</blockquote>

It's not being forgotten. Or here's a there's a business idea. Really, we need to figure out like whatever we want to add do something with our camera, configure. Okay. Put on the list. So it's not being forgotten. Like it's on there. And you can see where it is. Not only is it on there, but like this could be shared among your team. So as people had extra information or things to add to one of these projects, they can add it to it on the list. Right. So the information is aggregating. So if you use a tool like Trello for this Trello spelled T R E L L O. Okay. It's an app. It's a web based service that the metaphor is just index cards in piles. Got it. Right. But they're virtual. Okay. But you can flip over the index card digitally, attach files, write notes. And so I use Trello for my own organization, what I'm working on. So now you have a place where you can gather like, Oh, we just I just heard about something that's relevant to this thing I need to work on. You have a place to put it.

<blockquote><b>Cal Newport</b><br/><br/>Pulled up, right? You pull into the so you're fixing in advance. Here's how much concentration I have to give on work. And you pull stuff into that. The alternative is push based, which is how most organizations run, which is when I want you to do something, I just push it on to you. And now you have to deal with it. Got it.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Andrew Huberman</b><br/><br/>I once heard email described as a public post to do list. Yeah. That made me scared of email in a way that nothing else had. It's new ports, pull based system. I called it that, by the way.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Cal Newport</b><br/><br/>This is what in the a lot of the advice in the first one of the chapters of the new book is basically how do you get away with implementing this when you have a boss? And there's like all sorts of different. So you're your own boss. You can just say, this is what we're doing. Here's the board. But there's a lot of subtle ways you can do this. Yeah.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 3</b><br/><br/>All right. So that's number one.

All right. So that's one. All right. Number two would be multi scale planning. Okay. So now this is planning. You're planning on three different scales daily, weekly, seasonally or quarterly. However you want to think about it. Right. So you have a plan for like the semester, the season or the quarter. Like this is what I'm working on. These are the big objectives I want to hit. Here's to remind us to myself about like what matters like remember like I'm overhauling my my workout routine. We're trying to like do this with the podcast.

You don't need anything, you know, any special tools your weekly plan, you're looking at the actual calendar. All right. What from my bigger scale plan, my seasonal quarterly plan, what am I trying to make sure I can make progress on this week? And you confront the reality of your week. You see where's the empty space or there's the busy space. You also change what's on your plate right here. You know, if I cancel this thing, that frees up that whole morning, which means like I could really make progress on this, which I really want to make progress on. So great. I'm going to cancel that thing on Friday. So you're looking at the whole week as one unit, then every day you look at your weekly plan. Like, okay, so so I'm going to use this when I make my plan for the day. And when you do your daily plan, you do time blocking. Now I'm every I'm giving a job every minute on my work day, not my day after work, but every minute of my work day I'm time blocking. So I call it time blocking is you're literally drawing blocks around the free time. Okay, this I'm working on this, this I'm working on this. So you're making a plan for your day. That is informed by the weekly plan.</blockquote>

<blockquote><b>Cal Newport</b><br/><br/>And then you can mono focus because then it's a psychological hack. But basically, when you particularly, when you schedule communication and distraction, now the only thing you have to muster willpower to do is obey the single rule of I'm following My blocks. If you don't do that, if you're like, I just sometimes do email and social media, sometimes I don't. Now what you have to do is just constantly be having this debate, is now the right time to do this? And I'm going to do it at some point today. Why not now? Well, what about now? What about now? Like you're just constantly asking yourself, right? That's impossible, right? That's going to drain you. But if all you have to do instead is say, my commitment today is to follow my blocks. And I get I really feel good when I do it. And like, I check off a box, if I do give yourself some feedback here, it's a much easier cognitive battle to win, than just trying to be reasonable about, well, let me wait a little longer To check my email. Like you're going to lose that battle, you know, eight times out of 10, which is like enough to really overcome it. So that's like a hidden bonus of time blocking, is now you can really get your arms around separating different cognitively distinct activities.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Andrew Huberman</b><br/><br/>This is where the analogy of time restricted eating comes to mind. Again, not that that's the best way to lose weight or maintain weight or it's rolling longevity is still debated, etc. But I think for many people, not all, but for many people, the decision that they do not eat during certain time blocks and they do eat in other time blocks is just far more tractable in The real world for them than trying to limit portion size, decide whether or not they're going to eat or they're going to pass the cooking and have a little bit. Nope, they're in a fasting window. It's just it simplifies the issue. And as a consequence, I think it improves behavior overall. Although the clinical</blockquote>
